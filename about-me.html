        <h3>Bio</h3>
        <p data-testid="test-about-bio">
          I’m Abdulrahaman Ridwan, a frontend developer passionate about
          building clean, responsive, and user-focused web experiences. I enjoy
          turning ideas into functional interfaces using HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript, and I’m currently growing my skills toward React and
          modern web development. Beyond coding, I’m driven by continuous
          learning, creativity, and the goal of making meaningful digital
          products.

          You have come a long way, even through the moments that felt uncertain
          or slow. Remember that every bit of progress you made was built from
          patience, effort, and belief, even when confidence wavered. You did
          not quit, and that is something to always be proud of. Keep trusting
          your growth. Keep creating, learning, and staying kind to yourself.
          You are becoming exactly who you are meant to be, step by step.

          I have learned that growth is not a sudden bloom but a quiet
          unfolding, a series of small choices, patient days, and silent
          victories. Every line of code, every doubt overcome, every try that
          did not work out, they are all chapters in becoming who I am meant to
          be
